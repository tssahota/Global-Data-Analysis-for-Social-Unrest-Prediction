Project Execution Steps -> Execute the files in the following order:
1. "Final-EDA.ipynb" -> to observe the EDA for the project
2. "GDELT - LReg + RandomF + MarkovCh.ipynb" -> to build and evaluate LinearReg (with lasso), Random Forest Models, and Simulate Markov Chain for sequence of events
3. "H2O - GBM, IFM models.ipynb" -> to build and evaluate Gradient Boosting Model and Isolation Forest Estimator using H2O AI framework
4. "Event Sequence Prediction Using HMM.ipynb" -> to get the probability of simulated event sequence and test the model for random event sequence
5. "Dashboard UI.ipynb" -> to deploy and interact with a live dashboard
